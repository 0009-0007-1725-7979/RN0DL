## leveraging distributed architecture for network modeling to enhance real-time decision-making in broadband telecom
#### ABSTRACT:
Network modeling and optimisation has long been a well-established field of study, focused on addressing the complexities of network management, with the fundamental goal of improving key performance metrics. In recent research, GNN based network models have demonstrated remarkable capability in capturing the complex interactions present in network data without having to make assumptions about physical networks. While this characteristic facilitates the integration potential in different telecom networking domains of access networks, transport networks and core networks, the benchmark models exemplified by RouteNet and its successors remain computationally intensive, which becomes impractical at large scale. Capturing the complex interplay of packet flows across physical infrastructure such as telecom, demands significantly more computational efficiency. 
This research presents a scalable solution that leverages theoretical frameworks for parallelism to design a custom GNN network model suitable for large-scale network modeling and optimization. The architecture proposed in this paper expands computational capacity by decentralizing the learning process and flexibly scaling across available computational units. By incorporating distributed learning into model architecture, we propose a novel network modeling method that effectively addresses computational inefficiency, without compromising modeling accuracy offered by benchmark GNN based network models, making it especially suited for heterogeneous and rapidly evolving network environments. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation, we establish the applicability of the proposed solution for domains like telecom where operational efficiency is imperative. Our proposed architecture achieves faster convergence, with the speedup scaling proportionally to the number of computational nodes. Additionally, the overall training efficiency improves by 19.4%, highlighting the practical benefits of the proposed method in real world. This faster convergence, alongside a smoother training curve and improved stability, ensures efficient use of computational resources while preserving model relevance to real-time network dynamics. These advancements represent an innovative step forward in network modeling, driving the development of scalable optimization frameworks and addressing critical challenges in the telecommunications industry with practical and impactful solutions.
